# Speaker Accent Recognition

## Description

The objective is to analyze a multi-class dataset to determine if it is linearly separable in its original feature space, in the feature space defined by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in a new feature space with very high dimensions, or in all three feature spaces. To this end, we will use a multi-class perceptron to determine if the data is linearly separable and a non-linear version of PCA to project the dataset onto a very high-dimensional feature space.

## Pre-requisites
- Python 3.x
- A suitable environment to run .ipynb files (e.g. Jupyter, Google Colab)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository in your preferred environment.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the **requirements.txt** file. One way to do it is if you are setting it up on Jupyter, open the console on the project directory and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. You're now ready to start working on the project!
